        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Short and sweet, okay maybe not sweet but I guess it can be if we use sweet potatoes but thats for another day. This dish can be made healthily or absolutely down right coma inducing. This vegetable can very well turn you into a vegetable given enough salt and butter. So it really depends on the occassion I guess. As a staple part of my diet, I tend to not go all out on the butter and/or heavy cream.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the things we'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About 6 medium Potatoes</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Chives</li>

        
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Skin the potatoes and dice 'em up. Don't make them too big otherwise it'll take longer to boil. Give the diced up potatoes a wash before trasnferring to a suitable sized pot.</li>
            <li>Fill the pot with water and chuck in the potatoes. Throw in a tablespoon of salt and blast that heat up to maximum. Once the water starts boiling, that's when you want it simmer, so turn the heat down and leave it for a further 15 mins. Pierce the potatoes with a knife or a fork to test if they're done. It should go through with not so much resistance. </li>
            <li>Drain the water out and taste the potatoes for saltiness. If you can't taste it much then throw in a quarter stick of salted butter. If you can, use unsalted butter instead.</li>
            <li>Let that butter melt, kick back and just let entropy do it's thing for a few mins.</li>
            <li>Pour in a quarter cup of milk and start mashing it. Don't overmash it though because it starts to get wierd after that.</li>
            <li>Dice up the chives and sprinkle a fat teaspoon of black pepper. Mix a little more and you're done.</li>
            
        </ol>
