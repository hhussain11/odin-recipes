        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are many ways one can serve a fried bird but only a few  methods fly out the bunch turning our feathery friend into a face full of zingy, succulant and crispy chicken bites.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the things we'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>500g of chicken breast cut however you like. Be mindful of frying time though.</li>
            <li>2 cups of plain white flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of corn statch</li>
            <li>a whole bunch of seasoning</li>
            <li>Hot sauce of preference</li>
            <li>an egg</li>
            <li>oil of preference</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>If you want the absolute best fried chicken, truth is you need to brine it. Either in pickle juice, saltwater or whatever crazy concoction of spices you can think of. However, we can still obtain crispy and tender fried chicken that smacks with every bite. Like roy jones jr triple hook when you have the right dip. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a rolling pin or a mallet or flatten the chicken.</li>
            <li>Pour about a 1/4 cup of hot sauce onto the raw chicken and throw in some seasoning. Give this a good mix up. Use one hand so you can pour more hot sauce and/or seasoning. Cover up the chicken and let it rest somewhere.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, cornstarch and seasoning in bowl. </li>
            <li>Crack the egg in a plate and throw in some seasoning and hot sauce. Give it a good mix until it's normalised.</li>
            <li>One by one, dip the chicken in the wet batter we just created in the previous step, then dip it in the flour mixture and it on a flour dusted plate. Complete for all and let it rest for about 10-15mins. This allows the coating to bind to the chicken.</li>
            <li>In a wok or any other suitable metal thing in your kitchen to fry stuff in, heat up the oil to around 170 degrees Celsius. CELSIUS. Not Kelvin or Faren-whatever.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken pieces into your deep fryer for about 8-12 mins depending on the sizes. </li>
            <li>Pull them out and check the centre of a piece by cutting it. If its pink it needs to go back in. If it's white and you see no pink, you're in the clear. </li>
            <li>Finally, you can dust it off with some more seasoning and serve with your choice of sauces. </li>
        </ol>
