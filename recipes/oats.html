        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This one here ain't for your friday night funzies. Sometimes you need an emergancy source of <strong><em>nutritiously packed healthy complex carbs</em></strong>. Now those buzz words wont get you salivating but they'll sure get you to where you need to go when taste isn't a factor. Before we begin, we need to understand that these bad boys come in <strong>different sizes</strong>. I prefer rolled oats as the bigger ones tend to have abit more bite to them whereas I like it somewhat like a paste but not too pasty. If you want 'em smoother go for more refined oats, if you like a bit more chew in them then try out the bigger ones.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the things we'll need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About a cup of your preferred oats</li>
            <li>Water or milk</li>
            <li>Banana</li>
            <li>Berries of preference. I usually go for blueberres. </li>
            <li>A breakfast bowl</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a breakfast bowl halfway with oats.</li>
            <li>Pour in the water or milk until it just barely covers the oats and mix it with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Microwave it for a minute.</li>
            <li>Chop a banana into it and throw in the berries.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <p>Note: nuts are also a great addition. Be careful as you may be allergic to <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/017/788/gotem.jpg">...</a></p>
